                <h5>Store</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>The store is a single Javascript object that represents the entire state of the application.</li>
                  <li>It is the central part of the Redux application. </li>
                  <li>The store holds the current state, allows to dispatch actions to modify the state, and provides a way to subscribe to changes in the state.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5>Reducers</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>A reducer is a pure function that specifies how the state should change in response to dispatched actions.</li>
                  <li>Reducers take the current state and an action as arguments, and they return a new state based on the type of action.</li>
                  <li>The key feature of a reducer is that it should not mutate the existing state but instead return a new state object.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5>createSlice</h5>
                <p>createSlice from Redux Toolkit allows you to define both your reducer logic and action creators in a more concise manner.</p>
